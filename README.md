# Mutational signatures in breast cancer

The availability and the cost of whole genome sequencing data are limiting factors in cancer research. Reducing genome sequencing to the exome and still obtaining reliable tumoral characterization is analyzed in this project. It shows that using whole exome sequencing is not reliable to accurately compute mutational signatures found in the whole genome.

This work is meant to be reproducible. Since raw sequencing data (freely available at <a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download">COSMIC</a>) are too big to be loaded on GitHub I provide first stages preprocessed files (CV.txt and NCV.txt).

Interested by the project ? Please go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste 'https://github.com/vmaton1/MutationalSigs/blob/master/MutationalSigs.ipynb' if you do not download all files on your own machine. I am using HTML code that will not be properly displayed on GitHub.
