# Mutational signatures in breast cancer

One of the limiting factors in cancer research is the availability and the cost of whole genome sequencing data. Reducing genome sequencing to the exome and still obtain reliable tumoral characterization is analyzed in this project. It shows that using whole exome sequencing is not reliable to accurately compute mutational signatures found in the whole genome.

This work is meant to be reproducible. Since raw sequencing data are too big to be loaded on GitHub I provide first stages preprocessed files (CV.txt and NCV.txt).

Please go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste 'https://github.com/vmaton1/MutationalSigs/blob/master/MutationalSigs.ipynb' if you do not download the project on your own machine. I am using HTML code that will not be properly displayed on GitHub.
